    "War has been a terrible part of the human condition for at least thousands of years. The first half of the 20th century saw the entire world engulfed in war twice, causing widespread destruction and loss of life. The second half was also filled with war and looming over it all was the possibility of nuclear armageddon. The recent [war in Ukraine](https://www.cnn.com/world/europe/ukraine) and [growing hostility between the US and China](https://www.nytimes.com/article/us-china-tensions-explained.html) has made me, and I suspect many others, worry that another terrible war on the scale of the World Wars will happen in the next couple of decades."

    "In this tutorial, I hope to find some correlates of war and in the process, show the data science lifecycle from start to finish. I found a great resource for this called the [Correlates of War Project](https://correlatesofwar.org/). On their website, they have several data sets that cover topics like interstate war, intrastate war, militarized interstate disputes, trade, religion, and more. All of the data sets were made to be compatible with each other, which makes our job a lot easier."

    "Before we begin, there are some definitions and clarifications I need to provide. An interstate war is a war between states. The requirements to be considered a state by the Correlates of War Project are \"membership in the League of Nations or the United Nations, or a population of at least 500,000 and recognition (through diplomatic missions) by two major powers\". Interstate war is the type of war we are going to be focusing on. A dyad is a set of two countries and a directed dyad is a set of two countries where order matters (i.e. USA and Canada is different from Canada and USA). We will be using directed dyads throughout this tutorial. In the datasets and in our analysis, countries/states will be classified by a country code (ccode) which is a unique 1-3 digit positive integer for each country. More information about this is provided in the second code block.  \n",
    "If you are interested in doing your own dive into the data or would like to know more about any of the data I use here (how it was collected, coded, etc.), I encourage you to visit the Correlates of War Project website linked above."

Here, we are reading in the csv that contains these codes and creating a dictionary so that we can access countries by their code rather than their name. This is important because the names of countries have changed over the time period we are looking at (e.g. USSR -> Russia, Ottoman Empire -> Turkey). It is important to keep this in mind during our analysis as this will show up as \"Russia\" having fought in WW2, for example, when really \"USSR\" fought in WW2. This is okay for our purposes because we are not primarily concerned about individual states but rather the quantitative things about states that are correlated with war."

The other option is to fill in missing data with 0, but this would not be right. The maintainers of this data explicitly say, \"We do not equate an absence of trade data with an absence of trade.\". So we'll go ahead and do an analysis with this data and another with the data from 1816-2010 but without trade."

    "Let's first look at the pseudo R-squared. This number tells us the goodness of fit of our model. In this model, it is 0.1662. In the previous model it was 0.1628. This suggests that the second model is better at predicting our dependent variable (though not by much), which is another reason why we'll focus on this one. Now let's look at LLR p-value. LLR is the Log-Likelihood ratio and is the ratio between Log-Likelihood and LL-Null. The p-value is obtained by doing a statistical significance test. In our case, the value is incredibly small meaning we can be extremely confident that our model is better at predicting a country initiating war than the null model (the model that assumes no relationship between our variables and c1_initiated). As we move into the variables, I should preface by explaining what each number means in general. The coefficients are similar to what they mean in a linear regression. That is, that positive numbers represent a positive correlation and negative numbers represent a negative correlation. A larger magnitude represents a stronger relationship. However, since the dependent variable is binary, everything is in probability. So a positive coefficient for a continuous variable means that as that variable increases, the probability of the event occuring increases. The other number we are primarly concerned with is P>|z|, which is the p-value. This number is the probability of obtaining results at least this extreme. When this number is < 0.05 it means that there is less than a 5% chance that we've obtained these results due to chance and that the results are statistically significant."

    "Now let's look at each of the variables, starting with conttype. Conttype is a categorical variable, so each category has to be compared to a reference category, in this case 1. We can see that as conttype increases (meaning distance between countries increases), the coefficient decreases. What does this mean? Let's take conttype = 6 as an example, the coefficient is -2.3744. This means that being separated by > 400 miles of water is associated with a decrease in the log-odds of ccode1 initiating a war against ccode2 by -2.3744 compared to ccode1 and ccode2 sharing a land border. Of all of the conttypes, only 5 and 6 are significantly different from conttype = 1. This makes sense, that the further away two countries are, the less likely they are to go to war."

    "Moving onto the other variables, we can look at year next. Year is a statistically significant negative predictor of ccode1 initiating a war with ccode2, though not a very strong one. This is still good news and also conforms with what I would expect, that as time has gone on war has become less likely. Next is difference in capabilities. I expected this to be a strong predictor, however there is very little correlation and the effect is not statistically significant. Next is gained/lost territory in the past. Gained is not statistically significant but lost is and it has a small positive correlation. This makes sense to me, I gave the example of Germany and France earlier. Germany lost territory to France in WW1, and tried to get it back in WW2. Next is war in the past. This is the strongest predictor we have with a coefficient of 1.4382 and a p-value of 0.000. Lastly we have the number of militarized disputes in the past 5 years, which is also positively correlated and statistically significant."

    "Now we at least have some boxes. The boxes in a box plot typically tell us where the second and third quartile of the independent variable fall in relation to the dependent variable, but since most of our data is 0, the boxes also include the first quartile. The bar stretching above the boxes tell us where the rest of non-outlier data falls, and the diamonds above that are the outliers. We see that the No column has many outliers, this is all the times where several MIDs occured but not war resulted. We also see that the Yes box is taller than the No, this tells us that the distribution of the dependent variable for Yes generally has higher values compared to the No column."

    "We've been able to create a pretty solid model for war. There are some weaknesses of course. For one, things like ideology and religion were not included which many subscribers to the [Liberalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism_(international_relations)) school of thought in international relations would say is of primary importance. I was sad to see that there was so much missing data in the trade dataset and I still wonder the influence trade has on war. What was most suprising to me was that we were not able to find a significant effect between military capability difference. This could be due to institutions like the United Nations and the trauma of the wars of the 20th century that countries have realized that taking things from other countries just because they can isn't worth it anymore. I'd be curious to see if there is a significant effect if the data stretched further into the past, though the further back you go the harder it's going to be to find reliable data, certainly at the scale that is I have here. I was not suprised to see that the two strongest predictors were proximity and having fought a war in the past. Countries that are close to each other we would expect to go to war with each other more when compared to countries farther away. Likewise, countries that have fought each other in the past we would expect to be more likely to go to war again in the future. I was very glad to see that year had a negative correlation with war, though it was a very small correlation."
